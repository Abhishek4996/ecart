E-commerce website developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap along with Javascript/jQuery for front-end and MySQL and PHP for backend.

The site design was mainly done using Bootstrap and a few additional CSS thrown on top of it. The form validations are mainly done using a combination of Javascript and jQuery. The filters on the product listing page mainly used AJAX for it's working. The backend was developed using MySQL(phpMyAdmin) and PHP as the scripting language. The data was queried from the database and displayed on the website on appropriate pages.

Admin Panel(Work in progress): https://ekart.gq/admin

The admin panel uses the AdminLTE template which is available freely online. Presently I have only implemented the product section which includes adding new products and editing or deleting existing products. This is an implementation of CRUD operation on the database. Further work includes developing the user's section and implementing the feature of multi-vendor on the site.
